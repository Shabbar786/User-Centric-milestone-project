User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  
=====================

The is my static frontend-only website for a 1960â€™s rock band known as 'The Monkees'. The primary target was the fans for them 
to be able to use the site to access music either through an archive collection or any latest sounds available. Other features include Band availability
for private bookings and a new social media presence.
