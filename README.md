User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  
------------------------

The is my static front-end only website for a 1960â€™s rock band known as 'The Monkees'. The primary target was the fans for them 
to be able to use the site to access music either through an archive collection or any latest sounds available. Other features include Band availability
for private bookings and a new social media presence.

List of features ready and Todo's for future development

- Feature 3 - Responsive grid images when gallery link is selelcted.

To-do list:

- Improvement to be done 1 - Add a carousel feature as a menu option. To give it a more advance look with more option to choose from.
- Improvement to be done 2 - Instead of single scroll page add 4-5 pages with more features and technology enabling a more in depth view of the band.

### Testing
The aim of the site and user interaction was fulfilled. The webisite provided simple yet eye catching design and all required information was available to choose from.
In the Navbar section you had the main headings which, when clicked took you to the section through specific 'id' which was linked to each heading. 

A model was added to the news section and also when clicked opened up a dialog box or popup window that was displayed on top of the current page. Every link opened up a new tab whether the information was ther to view or not, 
just to be able to make it feel like a professional website.

Initially when testing site in responsive mode some images were not responding well to smaller screens sizes and were overlapping, which made the website out of place on smaller screens. This was causing the site to look visually
unattractive. The bug fix was to set the height of the images in CSS to 'Auto' and also in media queries certain height and font-size were reduced to requirement, this enabled them to respond on smaller devices.

Under the connect section if you tried to submit the email section without having entered anything in the box an error message will appear stating 'Fill out this field'. Also if you tried to enter
anything that was not an email address then also you would see a error message stating 'Enter an email address'.

All buttons had a subtle changes in color when hovered over them.

This site was tested across multiple browsers and many different mobile devices.
